## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Dashboard Won't Load Candidates**
- Verify Chrome/Edge browser usage
- Check that vault contains `.obsidian` folder
- Ensure candidate files have proper YAML frontmatter
- Confirm folder permissions allow file access

**Drag-and-Drop Not Working**
- Refresh the browser page
- Verify JavaScript is enabled
- Check for browser console errors
- Ensure files aren't write-protected

**Obsidian Links Not Opening**
- Confirm Obsidian is installed and running
- Check that vault path is correctly configured
- Verify Obsidian URI protocol is registered
- Test with a simple obsidian:// link manually

**File Sync Issues**
- Check file write permissions
- Verify `candidates.json` is being created
- Look for file conflicts or locks
- Ensure vault folder is accessible

### Performance Considerations
- **Large Datasets**: Performance may degrade with 500+ candidates
- **File Size**: Very large Markdown files may slow parsing
- **Network Drives**: Local storage recommended for best performance
- **Browser Memory**: Close other tabs if experiencing slowdowns

## Best Practices

### File Organization
